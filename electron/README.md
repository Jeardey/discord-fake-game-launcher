# Electron UI (Fake Game Launcher)

This folder contains an Electron-based GUI for the existing .NET launcher logic.

## Dev prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- .NET SDK 8

## Run

From this folder:

```powershell
npm install
npm run build:dummy
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The UI stores your installed games in Electron userData as `myGames.json`.
- It stores Discord's detectable app list in userData as `gamelist.json`.
- Fake executables are created under userData `games/` (so the app can run without admin rights).

If `DummyGame.exe` cannot be found, set `DUMMYGAME_EXE` to the built exe path.
